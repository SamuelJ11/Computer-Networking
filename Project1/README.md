## Note to Grader

This project uses the following 3 source files which must be compiled together:

    • pa1_skeleton.c    (main source)
    • HandleTCPClient.c (auxiliary function for server)
    • SetNonBlocking.c  (function for setting file descriptors to non-blocking)

A makefile was included to faciliate compilation: simply open a terminal and type 'make'; afterwards I typically run 'make clean' to remove unnecessary object files.

Once compilation is finished, simply run the program with the command line arguments provided in the project description.
